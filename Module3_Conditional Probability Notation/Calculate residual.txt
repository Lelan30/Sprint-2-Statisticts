##Calculate the residual for one data point

import pandas as pd
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/data-science-practice-datasets/main/unit_1/Concrete/Concrete_Data.csv'
concrete = pd.read_csv(url)
print(concrete.head())

#using the 5th data point index[4] plug in the content value:
#198.6 into Linear Regression Equation
#y = 0.08x + 13.44

#where y is the predicted concrete strength and x is the cement
#content
#y = 0.08 * 198.6 + 13.44 = 29.3

#the observed strength value for this cement content was:
#44.3 so the residual is: 44.30-29.3=15
