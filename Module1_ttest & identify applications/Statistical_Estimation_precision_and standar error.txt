#Error:
#the random variation when we are drawing random samples
#from a distribution

#When we sample from a population, we calculate the mean
#of that sample. Then, when we sample from that population
#again, we get different values, which can (and usually do)
#have a different mean. So if we took 1000 samples from the
#population, we would have 1000 various sample means. We call
#this set of 1000 sample means a sampling distribution, and
#this distribution has a mean (a mean of the means). This mean
#of the means has a unique name: the expected value of the mean.

#We can calculate the standard deviation of these means. Remember that the standard deviation is the sum of the squared
#difference between the mean

#To calculate the standard error of the mean (sem), we take the standard deviation of our sample (s) and divide by the
#number of samples

#We'll use an example from the food industry and examine  Cereal WeightsLinks to an external site.. Note: this is not an
#'actual company or product; the data is generated. In most cereal factories, automated machinery fills each cereal box,
#and the box's weight is on the package. The cereal weights data set provides the mean weight (in ounces) of 10,000
#sampling distributions of cereal boxes. Each box is supposed to contain 20 ounces of cereal (minus the weight of the bag/box).

import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

#Load the data into DataFrame
cereal = pd.read_csv('cereal_weights.csv')

#look at general statistics
print(cereal.describe())

#calculate standard error of the mean (sem)
stderr_mean = stats.sem(cereal['weight'])
print('The standard error of the mean: ', stderr_mean.round(6))

#The expected mean for this population of cereal is the advertised weight: 20 ounces. However, the sample distribution
#mean of 20.5 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.2 ounces would suggest that the factory equipment isn't hitting the
#exact target of 20 ounces: 20.5 Â± 0.2 gives a range of 20.3 to 20.7 ounces.
