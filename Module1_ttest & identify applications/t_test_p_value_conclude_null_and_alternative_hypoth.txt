#The process of this set of hypotheses might look something like the following:

#First, we state our null hypothesis: The mean heart rate in individuals who do
#cardiovascular exercise is not different from the mean heart rate of the rest of
#the population (78bpm).

#Second, we determine the alternative hypothesis:
#The mean heart rate in individuals who do cardiovascular exercise is different from
#the mean heart rate in the rest of the population (78bpm).
#We select a representative sample of cardiovascular exercise individuals and calculate
#the mean and SD heart rate.

#the null hypothesis is written out as:
#Ho : U(\mu) = reference value

#where \mu is the population mean of all
#individuals doing cardiovascular exercise:
#H0 : U(\mu) = 78

#The p-value is the probability of observing our sample mean
#if the null hypothesis is true.
#p-value < alpha: reject the null hypothesis
#p-value > alpha: fail to reject the null hypothesis
#We never accept a null hypothesis or prove it to be true, we can only fail to reject it.

#We want to test if a new method of teaching physics increases understanding as measured by higher scores on a particular
#physics test. Therefore, a random sample of 50 students who have learned using this new method is selected, and the mean
#score on the physics test is determined to be 74.6 with a standard deviation of 12.3.
#We then want to compare this to the entire population of physics test scores, where the mean is 67.5.

#calculate with scipy, create random test score for the general
#student pop

from scipy import stats

#Here are the 50 score from the class
rvs = stats.norm.rvs(loc=74.6, scale=12.3, size=50, random_state=42)

#calculate the t statistic for p-value
stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, 67.5)
