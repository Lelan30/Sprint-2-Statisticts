Q1.Which of the following situations would be one where we would use a one sample ttest?
A.When we want to determine if a population mean is equal to a reference value.

Q4.Consider the following test: A gasoline additive is created to reduce the amount 
of carbon monoxide (CO) in a car's exhaust. A sample of cars is chosen: half of 
them are given the additive and half are not. Test the null hypothesis that the 
amount of CO in the exhaust is not significantly different for the cars with the 
additive compared to cars without the additive.

What type of test is being performed here?
A.Two-sample independant t-test

Q5. (statistic= -0.6337, pvalue=0.53005) at alpha level .05
A.We fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

Q6.Which of the following choice gives the best definition of null hypotheses in two
independent sample test
A.The null hypothesis always proposes that there is no difference between the means of the two populations.
