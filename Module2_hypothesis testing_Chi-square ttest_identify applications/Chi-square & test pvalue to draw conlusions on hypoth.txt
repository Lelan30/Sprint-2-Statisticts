#Using a chi-squared test p-value to draw the correct
#conclusion about null and alternative hypothesis

#When we perform a hypothesis test, we calculate a p-value
#Using the significance level we decided on before performing
#our test, we have enough information to either:
#1: reject or 2: fail to reject
#1)p-value < alpha: reject null hypothesis
#2)p_value > alpha fail to reject hypothesis

#Using dice roll statistics as our data set, we're going to work
#through the whole process of stating the null hypothesis, performing
#a chi-square test, deciding on the significance level, determining
#the p-value, and then making a decision on the null hypothesis.

#we can estimate the expected frequency for each value by
#using a random number generator.

#Null Hypotheses: "Dice are not fair"

#We "rolled" five dice, each a total
#of 50 times. Here are the results, along with the total for each
#value between 1-6

#For this trial, we'll use an alpha level of 0.01. Our calculated chi-square 
#of 21.989 is less than 37.566. As with the example above, we can also use the

#of 0.01, so we can't reject the null hypothesis.
